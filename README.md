## About this fork

This is an unofficial fork of the StyleCop project hosted at [CodePlex](http://stylecop.codeplex.com). The StyleCop project has been maintained by Andy Reeves for several years, but has been on [indefinite hiatus since March 2014](https://twitter.com/stylecopdev/status/448202371798433792), with the [last commit to the project](https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop/commit/d9577105fee871b9f49cd7e86858b4044b99b192) being on March 31, 2014. Attempts to contact Andy since then have failed, and the need to update the project to (at the very least) update the ReSharper plugin to work with later versions of ReSharper means that a fork is the only viable way forward.

## Roadmap

The immediate concerns of this GitHub project are to get the ReSharper plugin updated to the latest versions of ReSharper. What happens after that depends on the requests of the community.
